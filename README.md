Case Study

How Betterment is Leading the Robo-Advising Sector

Company: Betterment, Incorporated in 2009, NYC.
Betterment is a Robo-advising platform founded by Jon Stein who graduated from Columbia University with an MBA and Eli Broverman who graduated from NYU Law School. Jon Stein studied economics and psychology and wanted to find a way to merge the two in a comprehensive easy to use platform accessible to anyone interested in investing. After graduation, Jon Stein worked in big banking witnessing how not all financial advisors put customers' interest first. Jon’s philosophy of prioritizing customers over profit was a major disruption to the financial advising sector.  The “hands-off” investing methodology of Betterment means anyone can plan for the future, save for big purchases and diversify their portfolio by answering a few questions on the app and an algorithm will create an investment strategy for the user. Betterment is different from traditional financial advising strategies by offering its user’s a range of services with a $0 start up fee and no account minimums required. Betterment is a retail platform offering a subscription fee of $4 per month or 0.25% annual fee paid by the “hands-off” investor, human consulting services for a fee and 401K plans built for businesses. From Betterment’s conception, funding has come from dozens of investors, the first notable one being a Series A from Bessemer in 2010 for $3 million. 
Business Activities: 
Since 2010, Betterment has raised over $435 million through ten rounds of fundraising. Major investors include Aflac Global Ventures, ID8 Investments and most recently, Kinnevik just to name a few. 

Betterment has a wide appeal making it the top Robo-advising platform. Betterment’s low rates, free checking account, 401K plans and fractional investment options make it attractive to the Millenial  and Gen Z generation who may have smaller upfront capital to invest with. Larger firms such as Charles Schwabb with an average customer age of 58 are often not accessible to beginner investors due to large account minimums and high service fees.  Since 2009, Betterment has attracted over one million active users with an AUM of $32 Billion with an average user account of $37.2 thousand. Competitors like Wealthfront and Acorns only utilize robo-advising. Betterment has human advising services available to customers wanting a more unique strategy. Human advising can offer solutions to more complex issues and future market projections. 

Betterment’s Robo-advising technology allows users to build wealth over a long term strategy. The algorithm uses fractional sharing, ideal for someone who does not have enough capital to buy a whole share of an ETF or crypto in turn diversifying users portfolios and solving the problem of idle cash. To stay competitive for its customers, Betterment has recently utilized Julia, a lightning fast language system. Julia’s complex language is able to ship updates to Betterment’s quantitative models quicker and with less risk of errors in the translation process. 

Landscape: Robo-Advising Domain
Tax loss harvesting is a key innovation many companies are using. Betterment and other platforms are able to reduce taxes incurred from capital gains by selling profitable shares at a loss. Buying similar assets from that sale keeps the user's portfolio balanced. 

The instant deposit feature has changed the way customers do banking. Betterment’s app has a checking account option with a recurring deposit feature. Customers have quicker access to depositing, withdrawing and altering features of their account’s. Ease of accessibility is what makes this sector so competitive. 

Wealthfront is a close competitor of Betterment’s with other companies and services like Acorn’s and SoFi to name a few. Betterment beats out other independent robo-advisor platforms  with the highest AUM of $32B beating Wealthfront by $1B and active users (1M+). In 2022 alone, Betterment did $100M in revenue, a 30% increase from the year before with a Valuation of $1.15B (nerdwallet.com). AUM grew by 50% in 2020 with a small dip in growth in 2021. A large part of the growth came from 401K plans from individual users and plans built for businesses. In Q2 of 2022, new user growth slowed by 1.2% YoY with an expected upswing in the second half of the year. 

Betterment has cooperated in every regard with the SEC regarding a Tax Loss Harvesting investigation that affected over 25,000 active users. Betterment failed to notify customers of a change in their software screening network of tax reductions for eligible users. Two coding errors were identified in the TLH  network excluding some clients from benefiting from TLH. Betterment  paid a $9M Regulatory fine in April of 2023. The fine was put into a FairFund and distributed to clients affected by the error and oversight. Despite the SEC fine, growth rates are projected to be 1.25% in Q1 of 2023 according to Forbes.com with a higher spike in Q4. 

Betterment is a solid choice for the novice investor interested in passive investing. A service that might benefit Betterment down the line is offering Real Estate Investment Trust’s(REITs). Wealthfront already offers REITs. These are good options for those clients who want a more long term investment strategy with higher risk but this may not align with Betterment's business model of only investing in ETFs. Welathfront’s customer base holding REITs earn 3.2% return yearly in dividends compared to 1.6% in dividends paid by U.S stocks (Wealthfront.com).  In an interview with Sara Levy, CEO of Betterment, Levy says “I think what we're seeing is that consumers really want more agency and more choice in their investment solutions but they also want to be guided. They don't want endless and infinite choice because they don't have enough hours in the day”(Kinnevik.com).  That is exactly what makes Betterment an undisputed top choice in robo-advising.
